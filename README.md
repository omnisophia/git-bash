# GIT BAA-ASH

We like sheep jokes. It gets BAAAD for us. 

## Description

For the lazy, the forgetful, the anal retentives, etc.  I present to you, GIT-BASH.  No more remembering the git commands in the specified order you need to use them in.  Git-bash will eventually turn into a rather complicated script very quickly. However, it will simplify how you deal with github immediately.  

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/omnisophia/git-bash.git
chmod +x git.sh
./git.sh

```

To all my frustrations on the CLI.



## Breadcrumbs

We used this exact script to update itself. Talk about inception!
